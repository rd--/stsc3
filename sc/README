Experimental extensions to the SC class library to allow .stc graphs to be played using SC.

At present many but not all .stc files in the help directories play.

- UGens that reorder arguments have different notation in stsc3 and sc, ie. Klank, Dseq &etc.
- The Sc autogen does not consider Mce inputs.
- Env.type and EnvGen are not compatible (ADSR and AR are)
