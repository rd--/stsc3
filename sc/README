Experimental extensions to the Sc class library to allow .stc graphs to be played using Sc.

C.f. <http://rd.slavepianos.org/t/sc3-rdu>

At present many but not all .stc files in the help directories play.

- Ugens that reorder arguments have different notation in stsc3 and sc, ie. Klank, Dseq &etc.
- The Sc autogen does not consider Mce inputs.
- Env.type and EnvGen are not compatible (Adsr and Ar are)
