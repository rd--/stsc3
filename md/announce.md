Smalltalk SuperCollider is a Smalltalk library for working with the SuperCollider synthesiser.

Smalltalk SuperCollider is research quality, it has minimal documentation and the current implementation is in terms of Haskell SuperCollider, which is required in addition to a Smalltalk image.

It does work though, and it may be of interest to people familiar with SuperCollider, Smalltalk and Haskell.

Smalltalk SuperCollider is at <http://rd.slavepianos.org/t/stsc3>

Haskell SuperCollider is at <http://rd.slavepianos.org/t/hsc3>

There are some short demonstration videos at <http://rd.slavepianos.org/?t=stsc3&e=md/video.md>

Smalltalk SuperCollider also includes an interpreter for Smalltalk programs where the only data type is the SuperCollider Unit Generator.  This interpreter (called "stsc3") can run the example graphs in the "help" sub-directories directly, without requiring a Smalltalk system.

Smalltalk SuperCollider works with Squeak, GNU Smalltalk, Pharo and Cuis.  There is an Emacs mode for working with either GNU Smalltalk or the stsc3 interpreter.

It should be relatively simple to add a mechanism for communicating directly with SuperCollider, patches welcome.

Best,
