Failures are related to comments.

Previously failed to parse:

- 1:9 [Allowed]
- p # q [Allowed]
- p.!(q) [Allowed, does renamer run?]
- p.++ [Allowed, does renamer run?]
- 1:k [Rewritten to (1 .. k)]
- (1, 3 .. 33) [Conflict, rewritten to 1:2:33]

The rule for (p, q .. r) introduces a shift-reduce conflict:

    | '(' expression ',' expression '..' expression ')' { stcFromThenTo $2 $4 $6 }

The operator methods require a translation function, i.e. ! -> exclamationMark, i.e. sw/spl/ts/operator.ts

Modified to pass:

- Dcv - Time varying feedback delay network.sl
  + s.Neg -> [[]]
  + ctl:: -> ''.kr()
- Jl - Pwm Crossfade.sl
  + let [f1, f2] -> let r
- Jmcc - Bach prelude.sl
  + x[3 4 5] -> x @* [3 4 5]
- Mk - 2206.sl
  + ctl:: -> ''.kr()

p.q in vector_item introduces a shift/reduce conflict
ctl::
