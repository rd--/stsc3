The Stc parser should directly generate an Expr Ast.

The comment rule is:

Line (//) comments are discarded

Block (/* */) comments are part of the Ast and may only appear as either:

- class comments (preceding class definition)
- method comments (first element of method body)

The block (/* */) form does not allow either nested comments or the * character.

"Any kind of sequence can be defined using either left recursion or
right recursion, but you should always use left recursion, because it
can parse a sequence of any number of elements with bounded stack
space."
