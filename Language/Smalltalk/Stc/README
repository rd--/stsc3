The Stc parser could directly generate an Expr Ast.

Block comments do not allow either nested comments or the * character.

There could be a distinct comment format that is part of the Ast and may only appear as either:

- class comments (preceding class definition)
- method comments (first element of method body)

"Any kind of sequence can be defined using either left recursion or
right recursion, but you should always use left recursion, because it
can parse a sequence of any number of elements with bounded stack
space."
