If the UGen graph is written as an expression to a text file for
interpretation by rsc3 or hsc3 the graph can be written without
proxied outputs, without applying multiple-channel-expansion, and
without applying KR rate editing.

If it is written without assigning unique-identifiers sharing will be
lost.

printLispOn:

UGen ->
(construct-ugen name:string rate:rate inputs:[node] mce:node|nil outputs:int special:int|nil uid:uid)
(construct-ugen "Out" ar (list bus) channelsArray 0 nil (uid *hash*))

Array -> (list ...)

KR -> (KR ...)
