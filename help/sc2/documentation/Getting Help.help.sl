# Getting Help

You can double click on a class name like _PitchShift_ and then type cmd-H to get help for that class.
(All classes are not yet documented in this version.)
Or you can choose Open Class Definition (cmd-J) from the Lang menu to open the file that contains the definition of that class and its methods.

If you double click on a method name like do and then choose Method Template or type cmd-Y then you will get a window listing every class that defines that method and the arguments it takes.
