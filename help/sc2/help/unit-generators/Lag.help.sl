# Lag - exponential lag

_Lag(in, lagTime)_

This is essentially the same as OnePole except that instead of supplying the coefficient directly, it is caculated from a 60 dB lag time. This is the time required for the filter to converge to within 0.01 % of a value. This is useful for smoothing out control signals.

- in: input signal
- lagTime: 60 dB lag time in seconds.

As filter:

	var x = LFPulse(300, 0, 0.5) * 0.1;
	[x, Lag(x, 0.002)]

Used to lag pitch:

	SinOsc( // sine wave
	  Lag( // lag the modulator
		LFPulse(4, 0, 0.5) * 50 + 400, // frequency modulator
		Ln(0, 1, 15) // modulate lag time
	  ),
	0) // phase
	* 0.3 // sine amplitude
