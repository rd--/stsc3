# Decay -- exponential decay

_Decay(in, decayTime)_

This is essentially the same as _Integrator_ except that instead of supplying the coefficient directly, it is caculated from a 60 dB decay time. This is the time required for the integrator to lose 99.9 % of its value or -60dB. This is useful for exponential decaying envelopes triggered by impulses.

- in: input signal
- decayTime: 60 dB decay time in seconds.

Decay time of one centisecond:

	Decay(Impulse(1, 0) * 0.25, 0.01)

Used as an envelope:

	Decay(Impulse(XLn(1, 50, 20), 0) * 0.25, 0.2) * PinkNoise()
