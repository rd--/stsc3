# Decay2 - exponential decay

_Decay2(in, attackTime, decayTime)_

_Decay_ has a very sharp attack and can produce clicks. _Decay2_ rounds off the attack by subtracting one Decay from another. _Decay2(in, attackTime, decayTime)_ is equivalent to _Decay(in, decayTime) - Decay(in, attackTime)_.

- in: input signal
- attackTime: 60 dB attack time in seconds.
- decayTime: 60 dB decay time in seconds.

One millisecond attack, one centisecond decay:

	Decay2(Impulse(1, 0), 0.001, 0.01)

Since attack and decay are a difference of two Decays, if you swap the values, then the envelope turns upside down:

	Decay2(Impulse(1, 0), 0.01, 0.001)

Used as an envelope:

	Decay2(Impulse(XLn(1, 50, 20), 0) * 0.25, 0.01, 0.2) * FSinOsc(600, 0)

Compare the above with Decay used as the envelope:

	Decay(Impulse(XLn(1, 50, 20), 0) * 0.25, 0.2) * FSinOsc(600, 0)
