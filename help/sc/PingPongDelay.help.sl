# PingPongDelay -- stereo ping pong delay

_PingPongDelay(left, right, maxdelaytime, delaytime, feedback)_

Bounces sound between two outputs. PingPong is actually a compound built upon DelayWr, TapN, and TapL.

- left: left input.
- right: right input.
- maxdelaytime: the maximum delay time in seconds. used to initialize the delay buffer sizes.
- delaytime: delay time in seconds.
- feedback: feedback coefficient.

Mouse control of delay time:

	var left = Decay2(Impulse(0.6, 0) * 0.25, 0.01, 0.25) * SinOsc(SinOsc(3.7, 0) * 200 + 500);
	var right = Decay2(Impulse(0.5, 0) * 0.25, 0.01, 0.25) * Resonz(PinkNoise() * 4, SinOsc(2.7, 0) * 1000 + 2500, 0.2);
	PingPongDelay(left, right, 0.5, MouseX(0.1, 0.5, 0, 0.2), 0.7)
