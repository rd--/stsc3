# PanB -- Ambisonic B format panner

PanB(in, azimuth, elevation, level)

- in: input signal
- azimuth:  in radians, -pi to +pi
- elevation:  in radians, -0.5pi to +0.5pi
- level: a control rate level input.

Output channels are in order W,X,Y,Z.  You will only hear the first two channels on a stereo setup.
