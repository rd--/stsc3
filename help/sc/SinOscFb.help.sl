# SinOscFb -- Feedback Fm oscillator

_SinOscFb(freq, feedback)_

SinOscFb is a sine oscillator that has phase modulation feedback; its output plugs back into the phase input.
Basically this allows a modulation between a sine wave and a sawtooth like wave.
Overmodulation causes chaotic oscillation.
It may be useful if you want to simulate feedback Fm synths.

```
{
	var x = MouseX(0.15, 0.85, 0, 0.2);
	var f0 = [110, 220, 440].atRandom;
	{
		var freq = f0 + f0.Rand;
		var fb = LinLin(LfNoise2(1), -1, 1, 0, x);
		Pan2(SinOscFb(freq, fb), 1.Rand2, 0.1)
	} !+ 16
}.overlap(2, 6, 3)
```
