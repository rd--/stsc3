SC3-Base.st

General (neither music nor SC3 specific) classes and methods.

SC3-Haskell.st SC3-Lisp.st

The UGen graph is written as an expression to a text file for
interpretation by rsc3 or hsc3.

The graph is written without proxied outputs, without applying
multiple-channel-expansion, and without applying rate-control editing.

SC3-Squeak SC3-Pharo.st

Methods that cannot be written to work under both Squeak and Pharo have separate definitions.
