`SC3-Base.st`: General (neither music nor SC3 specific) classes and
methods.

`SC3-Core.st`: UGen and math operator classes, related core classes
(mce, mrg, &etc).

`SC3-Env.st`: Envelope classes Env and EnvBuilder and related classes
(EnvPerc, EnvLinen, EnvASR &etc.)

`SC3-Haskell.st` and `SC3-Lisp.st`: Classes to write UGen graphs as
expressions to text files for interpretation by rsc3 or hsc3.  The
graphs are written without proxied outputs, without applying
multiple-channel-expansion, and without applying rate-control editing.

`SC3-Math.st` and `SC3-Random.st`: Methods that extend numerical
classes and sequence classes.

`SC3-UI`: User-interface classes and methods.

`SC3-Squeak` and `SC3-Pharo.st`: Methods that cannot be written to
work under both Squeak and Pharo have separate definitions.
